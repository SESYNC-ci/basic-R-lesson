## Parts and Subsets

Any single part of a data structure is always accessible, either by its name or
by its position, using double square brackets: `[[` and `]]`.

===

## Position

The first element:



~~~r
> income[[1]]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] 32000
~~~
{:.output}


The third element:



~~~r
> income[[3]]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] 89000
~~~
{:.output}


===

## Names

Parts of an object may also have a name. The names can be given when you are
creating a vector or afterwards using the `names()` function.

===



~~~r
> df[['education']]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] college    highschool college    middle     middle    
Levels: middle highschool college
~~~
{:.output}


===



~~~r
names(df) <- c('ed', 'inc')
~~~
{:title="{{ site.data.lesson.handouts[0] }}" .text-document}




~~~r
> df[['ed']]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] college    highschool college    middle     middle    
Levels: middle highschool college
~~~
{:.output}


===

Question
: This use of `<-` with `names(x)` on the left is a little odd. Whatâ€™s going on?

Answer
: {:.fragment} We are overwriting an existing variable, but one that is accessed
through the output of the function on the left rather than the global
environment.

===

For a multi-dimensional array, separate the dimensions within which a part is
requested with a comma.



~~~r
> df[[3, 'ed']]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] college
Levels: middle highschool college
~~~
{:.output}


It's fine to mix names and indices when selecting parts of an object.

The `$` sign is an additional operator for quick access to a single, named part
of some objects. It's most useful when used interactively with "tab completion" on
the columns of a data frame.



~~~r
> df$ed
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] college    highschool college    middle     middle    
Levels: middle highschool college
~~~
{:.output}

## Subsets

Multiple parts of a data structure are similarly accessed using single square
brackets: `[` and `]`. What goes between the brackets, to specify the positions
or names of the desired subset, may be of multiple forms.

===

| Parts     | Result                                            |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------|
| positives | elements at given positions                       |
| negatives | given positions omitted                           |
| logicals  | elements where the corresponding position is TRUE |
| nothing   | all the elements                                  |

===



~~~r
days <- c(
  'Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday',
  'Saturday')
weekdays <- days[2:6]
weekend <- days[c(1, 7)]
~~~
{:title="{{ site.data.lesson.handouts[0] }}" .text-document}




~~~r
> weekdays
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] "Monday"    "Tuesday"   "Wednesday" "Thursday"  "Friday"   
~~~
{:.output}




~~~r
> weekend
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] "Sunday"   "Saturday"
~~~
{:.output}


===

A logical test applied to a single column produces a vector of `TRUE` and
`FALSE` values that's the right length for subsetting the data.



~~~r
> df[df$ed == 'college', ]
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
       ed    in
1 college 32000
3 college 89000
~~~
{:.output}
