## Distributions and Statistics

Since it is designed for statistics, R can easily draw random numbers from statistical distributions and calculate distribution values. 

To generate random numbers from a normal distribution, use the function `rnorm()`


~~~r
ten_random_values <- rnorm(n = 10)
~~~
{:.input}

|----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| rnorm    | Draw random numbers from normal distribution                 | Specify `n`, `mean`, `sd` |
| pnorm    | Estimate probability of a specific number occuring           |                           |
| qnorm    | Cumulative probability that a given number or smaller occurs | left-tailed by default    |
| dnorm    | Returns quantile given a cumulative probability              | opposite of pnorm         |

R has built in functions for handling many statistical tests. 


~~~r
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 25, sd = 7)
y <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 50, prob = .85)
~~~
{:.text-document title="lesson-2.R"}


~~~r
t.test(x, y)
~~~
{:.input}
~~~

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  x and y
t = -21.308, df = 128.17, p-value < 2.2e-16

Linear regression with the `lm()` function uses a formula notation to specify relationships between variables (e.g. `y ~ x`).


~~~r
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
~~~
{:.text-document title="lesson-2.R"}


~~~r
summary(fit)
~~~
{:.input}

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

## Exercise 4

Create a data frame from scratch that has three columns and 5 rows. In column "size" place a sequence from 1 to 5. For column "year", create a factor with three levels representing the past three years. In column "prop", place 5 random samples from a uniform distribution. Show the summary of a linear model following the formula "prop ~ size + year".
