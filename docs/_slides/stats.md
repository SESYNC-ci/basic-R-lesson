## Distributions and Statistics

Since it is designed for statistics, R can easily draw random numbers from statistical distributions and calculate distribution values. 

To generate random numbers from a normal distribution, use the function `rnorm()`


~~~r
ten_random_values <- rnorm(n = 10)
~~~
{:.input}

| Function  | Returns                                      | Notes                     |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| `rnorm()` | Draw random numbers from normal distribution | Specify `n`, `mean`, `sd` |
| `dnorm()` | Probability density at a given number        |                           |
| `pnorm()` | Cumulative probability up to a given number  | left-tailed by default    |
| `qnorm()` | The quantile given a cumulative probability  | opposite of pnorm         |

R has built in functions for handling many statistical tests. 


~~~r
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 25, sd = 7)
y <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 50, prob = .85)
~~~
{:.text-document title="{{ site.handouts }}"}


~~~r
t.test(x, y)
~~~
{:.input}

	Welch Two Sample t-test

t = -23.846, df = 119.14, p-value < 2.2e-16

Linear regression with the `lm()` function uses a formula notation to specify relationships between variables (e.g. `y ~ x`).


~~~r
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
~~~
{:.text-document title="{{ site.handouts }}"}


~~~r
summary(fit)

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

## Exercise 4

Create a data frame from scratch that has three columns and 5 rows. In column "size" place a sequence from 1 to 5. For column "year", create a factor with three levels representing the past three years. In column "prop", place 5 random samples from a uniform distribution. Show the summary of a linear model following the formula "prop ~ size + year".
