## Special characters in R

Perhaps more than most languages, an R script can appear like a jumble of archaic symbols.
Here is a little table of characters to recognize as having special meaning

| Symbol              | Meaning                      |
| -------             | ---------                    |
| `?`                 | get help                     |
| `#`                 | comment                      |
| `:`                 | sequence                     |
| `::`, `:::`         | access namespaces (advanced) |
| `<-`                | assignment                   |
| `$`, `[ ]`, `[[ ]]` | subsetting                   |
| `% %`               | infix operators, e.g. `%*%`  |
| `{ }`               | statements                   |
| `.`                 |                              |
| `@`                 | slot (advanced)              |

Yes, the `.` in R has no fixed meaning and is often used as `_` might be used to separate words in a variable name.
