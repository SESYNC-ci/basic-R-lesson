## Introduction to R and the RStudio IDE

R is a programming language that was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1995.  R is popular for reasons including 

- it is open source and freely available
- it is widely used, both inside and outside of academia
- it is powerful and runs on all platforms


RStudio is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding in the R language. 
We will be using this platform to teach R, so we provide some introductory materials below.
