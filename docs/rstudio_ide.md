## Introduction to R and the RStudio IDE

[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language that was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1995.  R is popular for reasons including 

- it is open source and freely available
- it is widely used, both inside and outside of academia
- it is powerful and runs on all platforms


[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding in the R language. 
This course will use this platform to teach R, so we provide some introductory materials below. 

Please note that SESYNC provides a cloud platform capable of supporting the software needs for the course, so there is **no computational software for you to install in advance**. However, you are welcome to install any and or all of this software—it is all free and open source—on your own machines.  The list of software is available near the bottom of the [syllabus]({{ site.gh-pages }}/syllabi/2020/07/21/summer-institute.html).
