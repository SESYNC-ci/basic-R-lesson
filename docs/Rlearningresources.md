## R intro

### Comparison of R and Python

To get an idea of the features of both R and Python, it might help to look at a side-by-side comparison of the two languages. Be warned &mdash; there are a lot of "R Versus Python" blog posts where the author presents a heavily biased viewpoint and criticizes one or the other of the languages. These two posts provide a more balanced view, emphasizing that there is no one "best" language.

### R learning resources

These are websites and books that we've found to be the most helpful for learning R.

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) A freely available book that focuses on the "tidyverse" family of packages developed by Hadley Wickham and others
- [Computer World article on R resources](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497464/top-r-language-resources-to-improve-your-data-skills.html) with many more helpful links
- [RStudio's cheatsheet page](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets) PDF documents that list the most useful functions from a lot of different R packages &mdash; they look great pinned to your office bulletin board!
- [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org) A newsletter that comes out once a week. It is a curated list of links to articles showing examples of how people are using R, new package releases, and blog posts with R tutorials for beginner and advanced users. Highly recommended!
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) A freely available book that introduces data science techniques in a very accessible way with R examples

### Forums

If you are struggling learning R, you are not alone! We have all been there. These are three of the best resources for you to ask for help online.

- [StackOverflow, questions tagged R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) These are the questions asked by users on the site StackOverflow that are related to the R language. If you search the site for past questions, it is very likely that someone has already had the same problem as you, answered by one of the experienced R coders in the SO community. 
- [RStudio community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/) A site where users can ask questions both about RStudio and R code, and experienced users can help them solve their problems. 
- [R for Data Science learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) Originally created to help beginners work through the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book, this community now hosts an active Slack workspace for all kinds of R-related questions.
