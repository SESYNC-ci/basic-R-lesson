## The Environment

In the RStudio IDE, the environment tab displays the variables added to R's vocabulary in the current session.

===

- Variables do not persist between sessions (although RStudio defaults to automatic saving and loading of variables from a .RData file).
- Variables only change their value on re-assignment.
